        <div id="feature4-content" class="feature-content">
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The RDF Dataset Merger enables users to merge two RDF datasets by identifying and resolving conflicting triples. In cases where triples overlap or conflict, users can view each conflicting entry and choose which version to retain. This process ensures that only the most relevant and accurate triples are included in the merged output, which can then be saved as a new RDF file.</p>
            <p><strong>Why Useful:</strong> Merging datasets with conflict resolution allows users to integrate data from different sources without creating duplicates or inconsistencies. This feature is particularly useful in collaborative environments, where changes from multiple contributors need to be combined.</p> 
            <p><strong>Usage in VS Code:</strong> Users initiate the merge through the command palette, select two files, and review conflicts in a conflict-resolution view (a side-by-side view). After deciding on resolutions, the final merged dataset can be saved as a new RDF file.</p>

        <div id="feature11-content" class="feature-content">
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This feature enables bulk refactoring of IRIs and prefixes across RDF datasets, allowing users to switch between full IRIs and shortened prefixes in a single operation. For example, users can convert <code>http://example.org/name</code> to <code>ex:name</code> (and vice versa) across current document or entire datasets. This makes it easy to adapt the RDF data structure to project needs, improving readability and consistency.</p>
            <p><strong>Why Useful:</strong> In RDF data, balancing between full IRIs and prefixes can be crucial for readability and consistency, especially in large datasets. Manually converting each IRI to a prefix (or vice versa) is time-consuming and prone to error. By automating these bulk edits, it reduces repetitive work, minimizes formatting errors, and improves the overall clarity and maintainability of RDF files. </p>

            12. Interactive Graph/Visualization for RDF

        </div>
        <div id="feature12-content" class="feature-content">
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This feature provides an interactive graph-based visualization of RDF data, allowing users to explore entities and their relationships as interconnected nodes. Users can switch between schema views, which display the structural hierarchy of classes and properties, and instance views, which show specific data entries and their links. Similar to existing tools like WebVOWL, this feature makes it easy to understand complex RDF structures by visually mapping out connections and dependencies. </p>
            <p><strong>Why Useful:</strong> RDF data can quickly become complex, with multiple relationships and nested structures that are challenging to interpret in plain text. An interactive graph allows users to navigate RDF data intuitively, offering a high-level view of data connections while enabling detailed exploration of individual entities and their properties. This feature enhances understanding, speeds up data analysis, and makes RDF data more accessible to both new and experienced users.</p>
            <p><strong>Usage in VS Code:</strong> Users open the graph in a side panel, clicking on nodes to explore related entities.</p>

        <div id="feature13-content" class="feature-content">
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This combined feature provides a comprehensive overview of RDF datasets by offering users the choice to view either a VoID summary or statistical metrics. The VoID summary captures the dataset structure and interlinking relationships, complemented by the statistical metrics to provide insights such as centrality, connectivity, and node significance. By extracting and presenting these insights together, users can choose the view that best suits their analysis needs.</p>
            <p><strong>Why Useful:</strong> The VoID summary is valuable for understanding dataset metadata, making it easier to share and integrate RDF data. Statistical metrics help users analyze the structural complexity of the dataset and focus on significant entities. This combination supports a deeper understanding of RDF datasets by providing options for both high-level dataset metadata (VoID) and detailed data structure analysis (statistical metrics).</p>
            <p><strong>Usage in VS Code:</strong> Through the command palette, users can select to generate a VoID summary or view statistical metrics. The chosen overview is displayed in a new tab for easy review.</p>

            14. Allow Filtering of RDF Triples
            <span class="toggle-icon">▼</span>
        </div>
        <div id="feature14-content" class="feature-content">
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This feature enables users to filter RDF triples based on specific criteria such as subject, predicate, object, or namespace. By narrowing down the displayed triples, users can focus on particular section of the dataset, making it easier to examine relevant relationships or data points. </p>
            <p><strong>Why Useful:</strong> Large RDF datasets can be overwhelming to navigate, especially when looking for specific patterns or subsets of data. The ability to filter triples by subject, predicate, object, or namespace offers an approach to data exploration, allowing users to locate relevant information without needing to look through unrelated data. By simplifying the view, filtering enhances productivity, reduces visual clutter, and makes RDF data more manageable for both focused tasks and high-level overviews.</p>
            <p><strong>Usage in VS Code:</strong> Users define filter parameters, narrowing results to specific triples for easier review.</p>
