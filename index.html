            1. Predefined Templates for Common RDF Vocabularies
            <span class="toggle-icon">▼</span>
        </div>
        <div id="feature1-content" class="feature-content">
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This feature provides ready-to-use templates for popular RDF vocabularies, including FOAF, Schema.org, DC, etc... . When selected, the template inserts structured triples into the RDF document, defining entities with properties commonly used in these vocabularies. For example, a template for a person might include basic information such as foaf:name, foaf:age, and schema:address, with slots for values like name, email, and address details already laid out. </p>
            <p><strong>Why Useful:</strong> This feature is a time-saver, especially for users who frequently work with common vocabularies. Instead of typing each term manually, users can start with a structured set of triples that reflect the vocabulary's typical usage. For beginners, it offers a concrete example of how to apply RDF vocabularies correctly. For experienced users, it ensures faster setup and minimizes errors, helping to keep data consistent and standardized. </p>
            <p><strong>Supported Serialization:</strong> Turtle, JSON-LD</p>
            <p><strong>Usage in VS Code:</strong> Available through the command palette, allowing users select and insert available templates into RDF documents.</p>

            <span class="toggle-icon">▼</span>
        </div>
        <div id="feature2-content" class="feature-content">
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This feature allows users to create, name, and remove their own RDF templates, tailored to their specific data needs. Users can define any custom structure by setting up triples with their preferred properties, namespaces, and values, then save this setup as a reusable template. Once created, templates can be easily inserted into any RDF document with a single command. Users can also remove templates, keeping their template library organized and relevant to their ongoing projects.</p>
            <p><strong>Why Useful:</strong> Custom templates are invaluable for users with unique data requirements that aren't fully covered by predefined templates. By allowing users to create templates tailored to their specific data structures, this feature prevents the need to recreate complex setups repeatedly. Users can build templates once and reuse them across projects, ensuring consistency and saving time. </p>
            <p><strong>Supported Serialization:</strong> Turtle, JSON-LD</p>
            <p><strong>Usage in VS Code:</strong> Users name and save, as well as remove templates via command palette, then users are able to select and insert the templates through command palette.</p>

        </div>
        <div id="feature3-content" class="feature-content">
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The RDF Dataset Diff Viewer allows users to instantly compare two RDF datasets side-by-side, highlighting overlapping and similar triples in each dataset. Users can see which triples are present in only one dataset and examine detailed differences within similar triples, providing a clear view of any discrepancies. The triples don't need to align in both of the datasets. </p>
            <p><strong>Why Useful:</strong>  This feature is ideal for users who need to compare two datasets directly, especially when working with data from different sources or independently modified files. By showing similar triples, the Diff Viewer helps users quickly assess consistency, compatibility, and potential conflicts between datasets. </p>
            <p><strong>Supported Serialization:</strong> Turtle, N-Triples</p>
            <p><strong>Usage in VS Code:</strong> Users can access the Diff Viewer via the command palette, selecting RDF file for comparison against the current open file. Differences are highlighted in a side-by-side view, with similar triples marked and on click of this triples we get to scroll automatically to the similar triple on the other file. </p>

            4. RDF Dataset Merger with Conflict Resolution
            <span class="toggle-icon">▼</span>
        </div>
        <div id="feature4-content" class="feature-content">
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The RDF Dataset Merger enables users to merge two RDF datasets by identifying and resolving conflicting triples. In RDF, conflicts can arise in several ways, such as namespace clashes, semantic inconsistencies, or incompatible datatypes. Users can view each conflicting entry (just like in number 3 - "Diff Viewer") and choose which version to retain. This process ensures that only the most relevant and accurate triples are included in the merged output, which can then be saved as a new RDF file.</p>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Namespace Clashes:</strong> When two datasets define the same prefix for different namespaces:
                    <br>
                    <code>@prefix ex: &lt;http://example.org/&gt; .</code> (Dataset 1) <br>
                    <code>@prefix ex: &lt;http://another-example.org/&gt; .</code> (Dataset 2) <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Semantic Inconsistencies:</strong> When the same entity is described with contradictory properties:
                    <br>
                    <code>&lt;ex:Homer&gt; &lt;ex:age&gt; "34"^^xsd:integer .</code> (Dataset 1) <br>
                    <code>&lt;ex:Homer&gt; &lt;ex:age&gt; "43"^^xsd:integer .</code> (Dataset 2) <br>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why Useful:</strong> Merging datasets with conflict resolution allows users to integrate data from different sources without creating duplicates or inconsistencies. This feature is particularly useful in collaborative environments, where changes from multiple contributors need to be combined.</p> 
            <p><strong>Supported Serialization:</strong> Turtle</p>
            <p><strong>Usage in VS Code:</strong> Users initiate the merge through the command palette, selecting RDF file for comparison against the current open file; and review conflicts in a conflict-resolution view (a side-by-side view). This would be similar to GIT, we see the conflicts like in the "Diff Viewer" in number 3 above; after deciding on resolutions which to keep/discard, modify or merge triples, the final merged dataset can be saved as a new RDF file.</p>

            <span class="toggle-icon">▼</span>
        </div>
        <div id="feature5-content" class="feature-content">
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This feature combines autocompletion with support for custom vocabularies, allowing users to seamlessly integrate standard and user-defined RDF terms. As users type, the autocomplete feature suggests vocabulary terms for both predefined and custom vocabularies. If a prefix is referenced but not yet imported, it automatically inserts the appropriate @prefix declaration. Additionally, users can load custom vocabulary files, enabling autocompletion for terms specific to their projects.</p>
            <p><strong>Why Useful:</strong> This feature allows users to reference both well-known and custom vocabularies without manually typing terms or setting up prefixes. It is especially useful for projects that require unique vocabularies or project-specific terms, saving time and reducing errors. </p>
            <p><strong>Supported Serialization:</strong> Turtle, JSON-LD</p>
            <p><strong>Usage in VS Code:</strong> Users can configure custom vocabulary files in settings by specifying file or folder. As users type terms from both standard and custom vocabularies are suggested. Additionally, the autocompletion feature automatically handles prefix imports as needed. </p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This feature provides thorough linting, validation, and automatic formatting, ensuring compliance with best practices while maintaining readability. It detects and highlights a variety of common issues, such as unknown vocabularies, missing language tags or value types for literals, and data mismatches. The integrated Prettier-style formatter applies consistent spacing, line breaks, and indentation, and also allows customization of these formatting rules. For quick fixes, users can utilize syntax shortcuts and apply suggested corrections with a single click, improving data quality and productivity. Additionally, users can selectively ignore certain warnings to focus on priority issues.</p>
            <p><strong>Why Useful:</strong> This feature allows users to both detect and resolve issues promptly, while ensuring their RDF data remains organized and easy to read. The ability to apply fixes and ignore specific warnings makes it adaptable for both beginners, who benefit from immediate feedback, and advanced users, who can tailor the tool to their specific needs.</p>
            <p><strong>Supported Serialization:</strong> Turtle</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This feature verifies that property values match expected data types (e.g., names as strings, ages as integers) and issues warnings for missing required properties, duplicate @id values, and duplicate keys. Optional alerts are provided for missing @type and @id fields to enhance interoperability.
                <br>
                Additional checks focus on @context usage: they ensure consistency between property names and their definitions in the @context, validate correct usage of @reverse and @nest, confirm that terms in the @context map correctly to IRIs, and detect invalid nesting of @context definitions. Further validation ensures adherence to IRI/URL formatting standards, appropriate vocabulary usage, and compliance of @language tags with ISO standards. </p>
            <p><strong>Why Useful:</strong> This feature ensures data consistency and semantic accuracy in JSON-LD files, avoiding common issues like mismatched data types or misconfigured contexts. By flagging potential errors and inconsistencies, it helps maintain high standards for structured data and saves users from manually checking JSON-LD specifications </p>
            <p><strong>Supported Serialization:</strong> JSON-LD</p>

        <div id="feature8-content" class="feature-content">
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This feature detects duplicate triples within an RDF file, identifying redundant data entries even when they appear in different forms, such as using prefixed terms (e.g., <code>ex:name</code>) versus full IRIs (e.g., <code>http://example.org/name</code>). By flagging these duplicates, the tool helps users maintain data integrity and prevent data bloat, ensuring an optimized and consistent file structure.</p>
            <p><strong>Why Useful:</strong> Duplicate triples can inflate file size and create confusion. By flagging duplicates, this feature helps keep datasets clean  and optimized, promoting efficient RDF writing practices and readability, especially in large datasets. </p>

            10. Hide Long URLs for Improved Document Structure
            <span class="toggle-icon">▼</span>
        </div>
        <div id="feature10-content" class="feature-content">
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This feature hides long URLs in RDF documents to improve readability and orientation, replacing them with shorter, user-friendly versions (eg. <code>http://example.org/...</code>). This visual adjustment is purely for display, allowing users to view a version of their data without altering the actual URIs. Users can toggle the visibility of long URLs, making it easy to switch between a clean view and the original format as needed. </p>
            <p><strong>Why Useful:</strong> RDF documents often contain lengthy URIs, which can clutter the workspace and make it challenging to follow the document's structure. By hiding these long URLs, this feature helps users focus on the data content itself, improving orientation and reducing visual noise. </p>
            <p><strong>Supported Serialization:</strong> Turtle, JSON-LD</p>
            <p><strong>Usage in VS Code:</strong> Users can toggle this option, hiding URLs while retaining their functionality, also revert back to the original long url, through a mouse or command palette</p>

            11. Batch IRI/Prefix Refactoring
            <span class="toggle-icon">▼</span>
        </div>
        <div id="feature11-content" class="feature-content">
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This feature enables bulk refactoring of IRIs and prefixes across RDF datasets, allowing users to switch between full IRIs and shortened prefixes in a single operation. For example, users can convert <code>http://example.org/name</code> to <code>ex:name</code> (and vice versa) across current document or entire datasets. This makes it easy to adapt the RDF data structure to project needs, improving readability and consistency.</p>
            <p><strong>Why Useful:</strong> In RDF data, balancing between full IRIs and prefixes can be crucial for readability and consistency, especially in large datasets. Manually converting each IRI to a prefix (or vice versa) is time-consuming and prone to error. By automating these bulk edits, it reduces repetitive work, minimizes formatting errors. </p>
            <p><strong>Supported Serialization:</strong> Turtle, JSON-LD</p>
            <p><strong>Usage in VS Code:</strong> Users can select IRI or prefix notation, then activate refactoring across RDF datasets.</p>

        <div id="feature12-content" class="feature-content">
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This feature provides an interactive graph-based visualization of RDF data, allowing users to explore entities and their relationships as interconnected nodes. Users can switch between schema views, which display the structural hierarchy of classes and properties, and instance views, which show specific data entries and their links. Similar to existing tools like WebVOWL, this feature makes it easy to understand complex RDF structures by visually mapping out connections and dependencies. </p>
            <p><strong>Why Useful:</strong> RDF data often involves complex, nested relationships that are hard to interpret in plain text. An interactive graph simplifies exploration, offering a high-level view and detailed entity connections, enhancing understanding and data accessibility for all users.</p>
            <p><strong>Supported Serialization:</strong> Turtle, JSON-LD</p>
            <p><strong>Usage in VS Code:</strong> Users open the graph in a side panel, clicking on nodes to explore related entities.</p>
